My name is Jérémy Le Foulon and I'm a student in IT in CESI engineering school.
This account hosts github repositories for all the code I produce during my
learning process.
One public repo is available for each prosit I do.
My personal account is available at https://github.com/Jerem2360.
You can take a look there if you want to browse through my
personal projects.
